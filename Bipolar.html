  <h2><u>About Bipolar Disorder</u>. </h2>
 <div> 
  <p>

    Bipolar disorder is a mental illness marked by extreme changes in mood from high to low, and from low to high. Highs are periods of mania, while lows are periods of depression. The changes in mood may even become mixed, so you might feel elated and depressed at the same time. Bipolar disorder isn't a rare diagnosis.
    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    Bipolar disorder may include symptoms such as high energy, reduced need for sleep and loss of touch with reality. Depressive episodes may include symptoms such as low energy, low motivation and loss of interest in daily activities. Mood episodes last days to months at a time and may also be associated with suicidal thoughts.
    <h2>Why it may develop:</h2>
    Bipolar disorder is frequently inherited, with genetic factors accounting for approximately 80% of the cause of the condition. Bipolar disorder is the most likely psychiatric disorder to be passed down from family. If one parent has bipolar disorder, there's a 10% chance that their child will develop the illness.
    <h2>How can you help?</h2>
    Things you can do to help someone with bipolar disease is to respect their feelings between each severe mood swing they may have. Listen to whatever they have to say, listening to them while they talk between each mood change can help make it better understand how they feel at that moment. Suffering with bipolar disease can cause people to think that the whole world is against them which can cause to extreme violent reactions that can even lead to murder. To prevent this you need to always encourage them and make them feel loved.
    <h2>Treatment Methods</h2>
    The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counselling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Mood stabilizers such as lithium can also be prescribed to patients with extreme cases of bipolar disorder.
