  <h2><u>About Anxiety</u>. </h2>
 <div> 
  <p>Anxiety is a mental illness caused through stress. It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. The first day of school, going to a job interview, or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous. 
<h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    Common anxiety signs and symptoms include, feeling nervous, restless or tense having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom, having an increased heart rate, breathing rapidly (hyperventilation), sweating, trembling, feeling weak or tired, trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry, having trouble sleeping, experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems, having difficulty controlling worry and having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety
    <h2>Why it may develop:</h2>
    Anxiety conditions may develop because of one or more stressful life events. Common triggers include work stress or job change, change in living arrangements, pregnancy and giving birth, family and relationship problems, major emotional shock following a stressful or traumatic event, verbal, sexual, physical or emotional abuse or trauma and death or loss of a loved one.
    <h2>How you can help</h2>
    To help someone with anxiety you could encourage the person to get enough sleep, be physically active, and eat healthy food. Discourage the use of alcohol and/or drugs as a way to manage anxiety symptoms. Provide support and encouragement (not pressure) to stay connected with friends and family members and talk openly about what is happening.
    
    Psychotherapy. Also known as talk therapy or psychological counselling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders.
