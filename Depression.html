  <h2><u>About Depression</u>. </h2>
 <div> 
  <p>

    Depression is when someone is stuck in a depressed mental state where they cannot enjoy their life at any point, and it affects their motivation to do anything. Most people with depression cut themselves off from their family, friends, and hobbies, which causes their lives to be even duller and pushes their status worse. Depression is widespread and affects many young people around Australia, but it is merely looked over because of stigma and discrimination toward mental illnesses. In fact, according to Beyond Blue, currently 1 in 16 Australians experience depression. This means you should know at least a couple of people that has suffered or his suffering from Depression, but of course it is not easy for a lot of people to be open with their emotions and hard times. 
    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    Ways to spot someone that might have clinical depression is to see if they are constantly exhausted, not eating enough, Isolating themselves, poor memory, and less concentration. If you suspect someone to be going through a depressed state, or you think they are going through a rough time in general, the best thing to do is talk to them and ask how they are feeling. Helping them open-up about their emotions and let out their feelings will help them feel freer and lift the burden of handling it alone. 
    <h2>Why it may develop:</h2>
    There are many causes to Depression, but most of them come from great loss of personal connection, or from deep stress and anxiety. Although factors vary, and conditions are different for everyone. Some scientists claim that genetics are at play as well. Though this cannot be certain. Overall, neglection of self-love and lack of love and acceptance from others seems to be the broad reason as to how depression. 
    <h2>How you can help:</h2>
    Fortunately, times are changing, and mental health is getting more attention and support from everyone. Including funding from the government for research to find cures and spread awareness of sustaining a healthy wellbeing. Specifically for depression, there have been many treatments made, from pills to therapies. The most common medicine taken is anti-depressant drugs, such as SSRIâ€™s, which eases symptoms for depressed and anxiety moods and antidepressants, which eases depression symptoms. But most patients in initial stages of depression can take therapy, with varying focuses (cognitive behavioral therapy, behavior therapy, psychotherapy) which can prevent any escalation. Clinical Depression may be the most stigmatized and discriminated mental illness, as people who try open-up, and met with people telling them to get over it and claiming weakness. But this is not about how mentally tough you are, anyone is susceptible to depression, and because it is not talked about, we suffer the consequences. Suicide is the leading causes of deaths for people aged 15-44, in fact, 3,318 people have killed themselves in 2019. But by spreading awareness, and killing negative stigma, we can ensure a better future where discrimination against being vulnerable to become healthier, cannot dictate our mental health.
